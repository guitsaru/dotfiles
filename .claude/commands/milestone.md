You are breaking down GitHub milestones collaboratively with the user. Focus on creating logical, deliverable issues with clear dependencies and incremental value.

## Milestone Breakdown Philosophy

**Collaborative Planning**:
- Understand milestone scope together
- Discuss logical groupings and phases
- Get input on issue sizing and priorities
- Plan for incremental value delivery

**Dependency-Aware Sequencing**:
- Identify dependencies between components
- Sequence work for minimal blocking
- Enable parallel development where possible
- Consider risk and complexity in ordering

## Breakdown Process

### 1. Milestone Analysis

**Analyze milestone requirements**:
```bash
# Get milestone details
gh api "repos/:owner/:repo/milestones" --jq '.[] | select(.title == "MILESTONE_NAME")'

# Check existing issues in milestone
gh issue list --milestone "MILESTONE_NAME" --json title,body,labels,state
```

**Present analysis to user**:
```markdown
üìã **Milestone Breakdown: [Milestone Name]**

**Milestone details**:
- **Title**: [Milestone name]
- **Description**: [Milestone description]
- **Due date**: [If set]
- **Progress**: [X issues complete, Y total issues]

**Existing issues**:
- [Issue 1] - [Status]
- [Issue 2] - [Status]

**My understanding of the scope**:
- [Component 1]
- [Component 2] 
- [Component 3]

<!-- description: context-question -->
Does this capture the full scope, or are there other aspects to consider?
```

### 2. Scope Discussion

**Discuss scope and approach**:
```markdown
üéØ **Scope and Approach Discussion**

**Core requirements I see**:
1. [Requirement 1]
2. [Requirement 2]
3. [Requirement 3]

**Questions for clarification**:
- [Question about specific functionality]
- [Question about integration points]
- [Question about success criteria]

**Approach options**:

**Option A: [Approach Name]**
- Break down by: [Logical grouping - feature, layer, component]
- Benefits: [Why this breakdown works]
- Considerations: [Dependencies or complexity]

**Option B: [Alternative Approach]**
- Break down by: [Different grouping]
- Benefits: [Advantages of this approach]
- Considerations: [Trade-offs]

<!-- description: architecture-choice -->
Which breakdown approach makes more sense for this milestone?
```

### 3. Issue Structure Planning

**Plan issue structure with user**:
```markdown
üèóÔ∏è **Issue Structure Planning**

**Phase 1: [Phase Name]** (Foundation/Core/Setup)
- **Goal**: [What this phase establishes]
- **Deliverable**: [Concrete outcome]
- **Issues planned**: [Number] issues

**Phase 2: [Phase Name]** (Feature/Integration/Enhancement)
- **Goal**: [What this phase adds]
- **Deliverable**: [Concrete outcome]  
- **Issues planned**: [Number] issues

**Phase 3: [Phase Name]** (Polish/Documentation/Testing)
- **Goal**: [What this phase completes]
- **Deliverable**: [Final outcome]
- **Issues planned**: [Number] issues

**Dependencies I see**:
- Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2: [Why Phase 2 depends on Phase 1]
- [Other dependencies]

<!-- description: review-options -->
Does this phasing make sense for incremental delivery?
```

### 4. Individual Issue Planning

**Plan each issue collaboratively**:
```markdown
üíº **Issue Planning: [Issue Title]**

**Purpose**: [What this issue accomplishes]
**Phase**: [Which phase it belongs to]
**Size estimate**: [Small/Medium/Large/XL]

**Scope**:
- [Specific task 1]
- [Specific task 2]
- [Specific task 3]

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 2]
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 3]

**Dependencies**:
- Depends on: [Other issues that must be complete first]
- Blocks: [Issues that wait for this one]

**Technical approach**:
- [Brief description of implementation approach]

**Files likely involved**:
- [Estimated files that will change]

<!-- description: review-options -->
Does this issue size and scope feel right?
```

### 5. Dependency Mapping

**Map dependencies and sequencing**:
```markdown
üîó **Dependency Analysis**

**Critical path** (must be sequential):
1. [Issue A] ‚Üí [Issue B] ‚Üí [Issue C]
   - Why: [Dependency reasoning]

**Parallel tracks** (can work simultaneously):
- Track 1: [Issue D], [Issue E]
- Track 2: [Issue F], [Issue G]
- Track 3: [Issue H]

**Risk assessment**:
- **High risk/complexity**: [Issues that might take longer]
- **External dependencies**: [Issues waiting on external factors]
- **Integration points**: [Issues that need careful coordination]

**Recommended sequence**:
1. Start with: [Issues to begin with]
2. Then parallel: [Issues that can run in parallel]
3. Integration: [When to bring pieces together]
4. Polish: [Final cleanup and documentation]

<!-- description: review-options -->
Does this sequencing minimize blocking and risk?
```

### 6. Issue Creation

**Create issues with user approval**:
```markdown
üìù **Ready to Create Issues**

**Summary**:
- **Total issues**: [Number] issues planned
- **Phases**: [Number] phases for incremental delivery
- **Timeline estimate**: [Rough estimate based on issue sizes]

**Issues to create**:

**Phase 1** (Start immediately):
- [ ] [Issue 1 title] - [Size] - [Brief description]
- [ ] [Issue 2 title] - [Size] - [Brief description]

**Phase 2** (After Phase 1 foundation):
- [ ] [Issue 3 title] - [Size] - [Brief description]  
- [ ] [Issue 4 title] - [Size] - [Brief description]

**Phase 3** (Integration and polish):
- [ ] [Issue 5 title] - [Size] - [Brief description]

**Should I**:
1. Create all issues now with proper dependencies marked
2. Create Phase 1 issues now, others later
3. Adjust the breakdown first

## Example Breakdown Sessions

### Authentication Milestone
```markdown
üìã **Milestone Breakdown: User Authentication System**

**Scope analysis**:
- User registration and login
- Password reset functionality  
- Session management
- Multi-tenant user scoping
- Admin user management

**Approach discussion**:
üéØ I see two breakdown approaches:

**Option A: By user journey**
- User Registration (signup flow)
- User Login (signin flow)  
- Password Management (reset/change)
- Session Management (auth state)
- Admin Functions (user admin)

**Option B: By technical layer**
- Data Layer (schema, migrations, context)
- Business Logic (authentication, authorization)
- UI Components (forms, session handling)
- Integration (plugs, middleware, guards)

<!-- description: architecture-choice -->
Option A feels better for incremental user value. Agree?

**Issue breakdown** (User journey approach):

**Phase 1: Core Authentication**
- Issue: User Registration System
  - Schema, signup form, validation
  - Size: Large
- Issue: User Login System  
  - Login form, session creation, redirects
  - Size: Medium

**Phase 2: Password Management**
- Issue: Password Reset Flow
  - Reset request, email, password update
  - Size: Medium
- Issue: Password Change Feature
  - Authenticated password updates
  - Size: Small

**Phase 3: Administration**
- Issue: User Admin Interface
  - Admin user management, roles
  - Size: Large

**Dependencies**:
- All Phase 2+ depends on Phase 1 (core auth)
- Admin interface depends on user roles (might need separate issue)

### API Integration Milestone
```markdown
üìã **Milestone Breakdown: External API Integration**

**Scope**: Integrate with payment processor, notification service, and analytics

**Technical breakdown**:

**Phase 1: Foundation** (Parallel safe)
- Issue: HTTP Client Infrastructure
  - Configurable HTTP client, auth, retries
  - Size: Medium
- Issue: API Response Handling
  - Common response patterns, error handling
  - Size: Small

**Phase 2: Service Integration** (Can be parallel)
- Issue: Payment Processor Integration
  - Charges, refunds, webhooks
  - Size: Large
- Issue: Notification Service Integration  
  - Email/SMS sending, templates
  - Size: Medium
- Issue: Analytics Integration
  - Event tracking, user data sync
  - Size: Medium

**Phase 3: Integration & Polish** (Sequential)
- Issue: Error Recovery & Monitoring
  - Failed request handling, alerting
  - Size: Medium  
- Issue: Integration Testing & Documentation
  - End-to-end tests, API docs
  - Size: Small

**Risk mitigation**:
- Start Phase 1 foundation first
- Phase 2 services can develop in parallel
- External API changes could impact timeline

This sequencing lets the team work on different services simultaneously while sharing common infrastructure.
```

## Success Criteria

**Well-Structured Breakdown**:
- Issues are right-sized (completable in reasonable time)
- Clear acceptance criteria and scope
- Logical dependencies identified
- Incremental value delivery possible

**Collaborative Process**:
- User input guides breakdown decisions
- Technical approach aligns with codebase patterns
- Issue sizing matches team capacity
- Dependencies and risks are discussed

**Actionable Results**:
