You are documenting completed work collaboratively with the user. Focus on capturing valuable patterns, decisions, and learnings together.

## Documentation Philosophy

**Collaborative Documentation**:
- Identify patterns together
- Discuss what's worth documenting
- Capture reasoning behind decisions
- Create knowledge that helps future development

**Future-Focused Learning**:
- Document for the next person (or future you)
- Capture not just what, but why
- Include trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Make implicit knowledge explicit

## Documentation Process

### 1. Work Analysis

**Analyze what was accomplished**:
```markdown
üìù **Documentation Session**

**Work completed**: [Summary of what was implemented]
**Files involved**: [Key files created/modified]
**Scope**: [What this documentation session will cover]

**My analysis of patterns used**:
- [Pattern 1 I observed]
- [Pattern 2 I noticed]
- [Architectural decision 1]
- [Architectural decision 2]

<!-- description: context-question -->
What patterns or decisions do you think are most worth documenting?
```

### 2. Pattern Identification

**Discuss patterns worth capturing**:
```markdown
üìã **Pattern Discussion**

**Pattern: [Pattern Name]**
**What it is**: [Description of the pattern]
**Where we used it**: [Specific implementation locations]
**Why we chose it**: [Reasoning and context]

**Example**:
```elixir
# Code example showing the pattern
```

**When to use**:
- [Situation 1]
- [Situation 2]

**When not to use**:
- [Limitation or exception]

**Alternatives considered**: [Other approaches we discussed]

<!-- description: review-options -->
Is this pattern worth documenting for future reference?
```

### 3. Architectural Decisions

**Document significant decisions**:
```markdown
üèóÔ∏è **Architectural Decision Record**

**Decision**: [What was decided]
**Context**: [Why this decision was needed]
**Date**: [When decided]

**Options considered**:
1. **[Option A]**: [Description and trade-offs]
2. **[Option B]**: [Description and trade-offs]  
3. **[Option C]**: [Description and trade-offs]

**Decision**: We chose [Option] because [reasoning]

**Consequences**:
- Positive: [Benefits realized]
- Negative: [Trade-offs accepted]
- Neutral: [Other implications]

**Status**: [Active/Superseded/Deprecated]

<!-- description: review-options -->
Should this be documented as a formal architectural decision record?
```

### 4. Implementation Learnings

**Capture what was learned**:
```markdown
üí° **Implementation Learnings**

**What worked well**:
- [Success 1 and why]
- [Success 2 and why]

**What was challenging**:
- [Challenge 1 and how resolved]
- [Challenge 2 and solution]

**Surprises encountered**:
- [Unexpected issue and resolution]
- [Unexpected benefit discovered]

**Would do differently**:
- [What could be improved]
- [Alternative approach to consider]

**Key insights**:
- [Learning 1]
- [Learning 2]

<!-- description: context-question -->
What other insights should we capture?
```

### 5. Documentation Updates

**Update relevant documentation**:
```markdown
üìö **Documentation Updates Needed**

**Code documentation**:
- [ ] Add/update module documentation
- [ ] Update function @doc and @spec
- [ ] Add usage examples
- [ ] Document complex algorithms

**Project documentation**:
- [ ] Update README with new features
- [ ] Add to CLAUDE.md patterns
- [ ] Update architecture diagrams
- [ ] Add troubleshooting notes

**API documentation**:
- [ ] Update API docs
- [ ] Add endpoint examples
- [ ] Document new parameters
- [ ] Update response formats

<!-- description: review-options -->
Which documentation updates are most important?
```

### 6. Knowledge Sharing

**Share learnings with team/future**:
```markdown
ü§ù **Knowledge Sharing**

**Blog post/article potential**:
- [Topic that could be interesting to share]
- [Approach that might help others]

**Internal documentation**:
- [Pattern to add to team wiki]
- [Decision to record in ADR]

**Code comments to add**:
- [Complex logic that needs explaining]
- [Why certain approach was taken]

**Mentoring notes**:
- [What someone new should know]
- [Common mistakes to avoid]

<!-- description: context-question -->
What knowledge would be most valuable to share?
```

## Documentation Types

### Pattern Documentation
- Reusable code patterns
- Architectural patterns
- Testing patterns
- Integration patterns
- Performance patterns

### Decision Records
- Why specific technologies chosen
- Architectural trade-offs made
- Process decisions
- Tool selections
- Design constraints

### Implementation Notes
- Complex algorithm explanations
- Integration gotchas
- Performance considerations
- Security implications

## Example Documentation Sessions

### Pattern Documentation
```markdown
üìã **Multi-Tenant Query Pattern**

**Pattern discovered**: All data access functions follow consistent org_id scoping

**Implementation**:
```elixir
def list_for_organization(query, org_id) do
  from(q in query, where: q.org_id == ^org_id)
end

# Used in:
# - Accounts.list_users_for_organization/1
# - Notifications.list_notifications_for_organization/1  
# - Content.list_posts_for_organization/1
```

**Benefits**:
- Consistent data isolation
- Easy to audit for security
- Prevents data leaks between orgs

**Should we**:
1. Extract into a shared module
2. Document as standard pattern
3. Create a custom Ecto macro

<!-- description: architecture-choice -->
What's your preference for formalizing this pattern?
```

### Architectural Decision
```markdown
üèóÔ∏è **Real-time Update Architecture**

**Decision**: Use Phoenix PubSub + LiveView for notifications

**Context**: Need real-time notifications without additional infrastructure

**Options considered**:
- WebSockets + custom protocol: More control, more complexity
- Polling: Simple, not truly real-time
- PubSub + LiveView: Leverages existing infrastructure

**Why PubSub + LiveView**:
- Already using Phoenix and LiveView
- No additional services to manage
- Integrates cleanly with existing code
- Good performance characteristics

**Implementation learnings**:
- Topic naming convention: "user:#{user_id}:notifications"
- Graceful degradation when user offline
- Batch updates for performance

**Future considerations**:
- May need WebSocket approach for mobile apps
- Consider message persistence for offline users

<!-- description: review-options -->
Worth adding this to our architecture decisions?
```

### Implementation Learning
```markdown
üí° **Database Migration Learning**

**Challenge**: Adding org_id to existing table with data

**Solution approaches tried**:
1. **Add column + backfill**: Worked but slow
2. **New table + migrate data**: Clean but complex
3. **Gradual migration**: Implemented

**What we learned**:
- Large table migrations need special handling
- Default values can cause lock issues
- Gradual approach preserves system availability

**Pattern for future**:
```elixir
# Step 1: Add nullable column
add :org_id, :uuid

# Step 2: Backfill in batches (separate script)
# Step 3: Add not null constraint
# Step 4: Add indexes
```

**Documentation to update**:
- Migration best practices guide
- Large table migration checklist

<!-- description: review-options -->
Should we create a migration playbook from this?
```
