# Rule: Brainstorming Strategic Epic Ideas

## Goal

Generate strategic epic ideas that align with product vision, solve real user problems, and advance the product roadmap. Help solo founders think beyond immediate features to strategic initiatives.

## Process

1. **Context Gathering**: Understand product, stage, audience, and challenges
2. **Brainstorming Frameworks**: Use multiple approaches to generate diverse ideas
3. **Epic Development**: Structure ideas with business value and technical considerations
4. **Prioritization**: Score and rank ideas strategically
5. **Integration Options**: Create Linear epics, PRDs, or research spikes

## Context Gathering

First, understand the product context through targeted questions:

### Product Questions:
* **Product Focus**: "Which product? a) Nebula, b) Stellar, c) Pulsar, d) Simple Thai, e) Wug, f) New product"
* **Stage**: "Current stage? a) Pre-launch, b) MVP, c) Growth, d) Mature"
* **Target Audience**: "Target audience? (developers, language learners, etc.)"
* **User Base**: "Current user count? (if applicable)"

### Strategic Context:
* **Main Challenge**: "What's your current main challenge? a) User acquisition b) User retention c) Revenue generation d) Technical debt e) Feature parity with competitors f) Performance/scale g) User experience"
* **Time Horizon**: "Time horizon for new epics? a) Next month (urgent) b) This quarter (soon) c) Next quarter (planned) d) This year (strategic) e) Blue sky (vision)"

### Analysis Request:
* **Existing Data**: "Should I analyze existing Linear issues to identify patterns?"
* **Competitive Research**: "Any competitor features to consider?"
* **User Feedback**: "Recent user feedback to incorporate?"
* **Technical Constraints**: "Technical constraints to consider?"

## Brainstorming Frameworks

Use multiple frameworks to generate diverse, strategic ideas:

### A. Jobs-to-be-Done Analysis
```
What job are users hiring your product to do?
- Primary job: [Main purpose users have]
- Related jobs: [Adjacent needs they have]
- Emotional jobs: [How they want to feel]

Epic ideas that better accomplish these jobs:
1. [Epic that makes primary job easier]
2. [Epic that handles related job]
3. [Epic that addresses emotional need]
```

### B. Problem-Solution Matrix
| User Problem | Current Solution | Proposed Epic |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| [Pain point] | [How they cope] | [Epic idea]   |

### C. Value Chain Analysis
```
User Journey: Discover ‚Üí Try ‚Üí Learn ‚Üí Use ‚Üí Succeed ‚Üí Share
Where are the gaps? What epics would fill them?
```

### D. Platform Expansion
```
Current: [What you have]
Adjacent: [Natural extensions]
Transform: [New possibilities]
```

### E. Competitive Gap Analysis
```
What do competitors do that you don't?
What do you do that competitors don't?
What does nobody do well?
```

## Epic Generation Template

### Key Features
1. [Core feature 1]
2. [Core feature 2]  
3. [Core feature 3]

### User Value
- **Immediate value**: [What users get right away]
- **Long-term value**: [What this enables over time]
- **Differentiator**: [Why this is unique]

### Business Value
- **Revenue impact**: [Direct, indirect, or retention]
- **Strategic value**: [Market position, moat, etc.]
- **Effort estimate**: [S/M/L/XL]
- **Risk level**: [Low/Medium/High]

### Success Metrics
- [Metric 1]: Target value
- [Metric 2]: Target value
- [Metric 3]: Target value

### Technical Considerations
- **Architecture impact**: [Major/Minor/None]
- **New dependencies**: [What's needed]
- **Performance impact**: [Positive/Neutral/Negative]
- **Technical debt addressed**: [If any]

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**: [Minimal valuable version]
2. **Phase 2 (Enhanced)**: [Added value]
3. **Phase 3 (Complete)**: [Full vision]

### Open Questions
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]

### Similar/Competing Features
- [Competitor X does Y]
- [Alternative approach Z]

### Priority Score
- **User Impact**: [1-5]
- **Business Value**: [1-5]
- **Technical Fit**: [1-5]
- **Effort Required**: [1-5, lower is better]
- **Total**: [Sum or weighted score]
```

## Output: Epic Ideas Report
