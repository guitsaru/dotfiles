2. **Research Execution**: Systematic data gathering using web search and analysis
3. **Framework Analysis**: Apply strategic frameworks for deeper insights
4. **Report Generation**: Create comprehensive, actionable market research report
5. **Integration Options**: Connect to epic ideas, PRDs, or validation planning

## Research Scope Definition

### Initial Input:
