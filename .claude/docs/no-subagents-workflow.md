# Claude Code Configuration Without Subagents

This configuration demonstrates how to achieve sophisticated workflow orchestration using Claude Code's built-in features (commands, hooks, and output styles) instead of subagents.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Commands as Workflow Orchestrators
Commands handle complex multi-phase workflows with state management and user checkpoints.

**Key Commands:**
- `github-issue`: Complete issue workflow (planning → implementation → documentation)
- `github-milestone`: Break down milestones into actionable issues
- `github-review`: Comprehensive PR review workflow
- `continue`: Resume work from current state
- `plan`: Direct access to planning phase
- `document`: Direct access to documentation phase

### 2. Output Styles for Specialized Context
Output styles provide domain-specific templates and patterns that are automatically applied based on file patterns.

**Available Styles:**
- `database-work`: PostgreSQL/Ecto migrations and schemas
- `liveview-ui`: Phoenix LiveView components with Tailwind/DaisyUI
- `testing-patterns`: ExUnit and property-based testing
- `api-development`: RESTful and GraphQL patterns
- `documentation`: ExDoc and markdown standards

### 3. Hooks for Quality Control
Hooks automate quality checks and workflow transitions at key points.

**Active Hooks:**
- `pre-commit`: Format, lint, and test before commits
- `post-implementation`: Final validation after task completion
- `pre-pr-creation`: Validate readiness before creating PR
- `post-task-completion`: Quick checks after each task
- `migration-check`: Validate database migrations
- `security-check`: Audit auth-related changes (optional)
- `performance-check`: Run benchmarks (optional)

## Workflow Example: GitHub Issue Implementation

### Without Subagents (New Approach)
```bash
# User invokes command
/github-issue 123

# Claude Code:
1. Detects PR state using command logic
2. Applies appropriate output style based on work type
3. Uses hooks for quality gates
4. Manages workflow through TODO list
5. Applies user checkpoints for control
```

### Key Differences from Subagent Approach

**Advantages:**
- **Simpler**: Everything is a command, hook, or style
- **Faster**: No agent spawning overhead
- **Transparent**: All logic visible in configuration files
- **Predictable**: Deterministic routing based on patterns
- **User Control**: Explicit checkpoints and approval flows

**State Management:**
- PR bodies store action plans
- TODO list tracks current task
- Git commits preserve history
- Comments document decisions

## How It Works

### Phase-Based Workflow
Each command implements phases internally:

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Detect current state
   - Apply relevant output style
   - Prepare context

2. **Execution Phase**
   - Run with specialized patterns
   - Trigger hooks at checkpoints
   - Update TODO list

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Run quality checks via hooks
   - Document patterns
   - Prepare for next phase

### Automatic Style Application
Based on file patterns, the appropriate output style is automatically applied:

```json
"output_styles": {
  "database-work": {
    "file_patterns": ["**/migrations/*.exs", "**/schemas/*.ex"],
    "style_file": "output-styles/database-work.md"
  }
}
```

### Hook Integration
Hooks run automatically at defined trigger points:

```json
"hooks": {
  "pre-commit": {
    "command": "mix format && mix test",
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

## Customization

### Adding New Workflows
1. Create command file in `commands/`
2. Define phases and checkpoints
3. Include state detection logic
4. Add user control points

### Adding Output Styles
1. Create style file in `output-styles/`
2. Define templates and patterns
3. Add to settings.json with file patterns
4. Style auto-applies to matching files

### Adding Hooks
1. Define hook in settings.json
2. Specify trigger condition
3. Add command to run
4. Enable/disable as needed

## Migration from Subagents

If you're migrating from a subagent-based workflow:

1. **Commands replace agent orchestration**
   - `github-issue-planner` → Planning phase in command
   - `implementation-executor` → Execution phase in command
   - `pattern-documenter` → Documentation phase in command

2. **Output styles replace specialized agents**
   - `postgres-ecto-architect` → `database-work` style
   - `liveview-frontend-expert` → `liveview-ui` style
   - `test-architect` → `testing-patterns` style

3. **Hooks replace agent handoffs**
   - Quality gates between phases
   - Automatic validation
   - Error recovery flows

## Best Practices

1. **Use Commands for Workflows**
   - Multi-phase operations
   - Complex state management
   - User interaction points

2. **Use Output Styles for Patterns**
   - Domain-specific templates
   - Consistent formatting
   - Reusable components

3. **Use Hooks for Automation**
   - Quality checks
   - Validation gates
   - Workflow transitions

4. **Maintain State Through**
   - PR bodies for plans
   - TODO lists for progress
   - Git for history
   - Comments for decisions

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Working
- Check command file exists in `commands/`
- Verify command name in settings.json
- Review command file syntax

### Style Not Applying
- Check file pattern matches
- Verify style file exists
- Confirm auto_apply is true

### Hook Not Triggering
- Check enabled status
- Verify trigger condition
- Test command manually first

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to further improve the workflow:

1. **Conditional Hooks**
   - Branch-based triggers
   - File-count thresholds
   - Time-based execution

2. **Dynamic Styles**
   - Context-aware templates
   - Project-specific patterns
   - Learning from codebase

3. **Workflow Composition**
   - Combine multiple commands
   - Chain workflows
   - Parallel execution

This configuration provides all the power of subagent workflows while maintaining simplicity and transparency through Claude Code's native features.
