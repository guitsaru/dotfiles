# Claude Code Configuration

A sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system for Claude Code, optimized for Elixir/Phoenix development with interactive workflow controls and quality gates.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Full issue implementation with planning ‚Üí execution ‚Üí documentation
claude github-issue #127

# Break down milestone into actionable issues
claude github-milestone "User Authentication System"

# Comprehensive PR review with specialist coordination
claude github-review PR#89

# Resume work from current state
claude continue
```

## üéØ Core Philosophy

This configuration transforms Claude Code from a simple assistant into an **intelligent workflow orchestrator** that:

- **Seeks your approval** at every major decision point
- **Routes work** to specialized agents based on file patterns and complexity
- **Maintains context** across multi-step workflows
- **Enforces quality gates** with automated testing and linting
- **Documents learnings** for future reference and team sharing

## üìã Available Commands

### Primary Workflows

#### `claude github-issue <issue-number>`
**Complete issue implementation orchestrator**

**Flow:**
1. **Planning Phase**: Analyzes issue, asks clarification questions, creates action plan
2. **üë§ USER APPROVAL**: Review plan and type `APPROVED` to continue
3. **Implementation Phase**: Executes tasks with focused commits
4. **üë§ USER REVIEW**: Review each change, type `COMMIT` to proceed
5. **Documentation Phase**: Captures patterns and updates knowledge base

**Example:**
```bash
claude github-issue #127
# ‚Üí Analyzes "Add rate limiting to API endpoints"
# ‚Üí Asks clarifying questions about rate limits and Redis usage
# ‚Üí Creates detailed action plan with 6 implementation steps
# ‚Üí Waits for your approval before creating PR
# ‚Üí Executes each step with commit approval checkpoints
# ‚Üí Documents patterns for future rate limiting features
```

#### `claude github-milestone "<milestone-name>"`
**Intelligent milestone breakdown orchestrator**

**Flow:**
1. **Analysis Phase**: Fetches milestone, analyzes scope and complexity
2. **üë§ SCOPE CONFIRMATION**: Validates understanding before breakdown
3. **Breakdown Phase**: Creates small, deliverable issues with dependencies
4. **üë§ USER APPROVAL**: Review breakdown before GitHub issue creation
5. **Creation Phase**: Generates GitHub issues with proper labels and links

**Example:**
```bash
claude github-milestone "User Authentication System"
# ‚Üí Analyzes milestone scope and current requirements
# ‚Üí Confirms: "This involves OAuth, TOTP, and session management. Correct?"
# ‚Üí Creates 8 issues: database schema, OAuth integration, TOTP setup, etc.
# ‚Üí Shows dependency graph and thin-slice delivery plan
# ‚Üí Creates GitHub issues only after your approval
```

#### `claude github-review <pr-number>`
**Multi-specialist PR review orchestrator**

**Flow:**
1. **Analysis Phase**: Detects PR scope (UI, database, security, etc.)
2. **Specialist Routing**: Routes to appropriate expert agents
3. **Review Synthesis**: Combines findings from multiple specialists
4. **Report Generation**: Creates actionable improvement checklist

**Example:**
```bash
claude github-review PR#89
# ‚Üí Detects LiveView components + database migrations
# ‚Üí Routes to liveview-frontend-expert + postgres-ecto-architect
# ‚Üí Analyzes UI patterns, accessibility, and database performance
# ‚Üí Synthesizes review with prioritized recommendations
```

### Workflow Shortcuts

#### `claude continue`
**Resume work from current state**

Auto-detects your current PR context and resumes implementation:
```bash
# On branch feature/user-auth with existing PR
claude continue
# ‚Üí Detects PR #45, reads action plan progress
# ‚Üí Resumes from "Step 4: Implement password validation"
# ‚Üí Shows exactly where you left off
```

#### `claude plan <issue-number>`
**Direct access to planning phase**

Bypass orchestration for quick planning:
```bash
claude plan #127
# ‚Üí Routes directly to github-issue-planner
# ‚Üí Creates implementation plan without full workflow
```

#### `claude document <pr-number>`
**Direct access to documentation phase**

Document completed work patterns:
```bash
claude document PR#89
# ‚Üí Routes to pattern-documenter
# ‚Üí Captures implementation learnings
# ‚Üí Updates related issues with insights
```

```

### Milestone Planning to Implementation

```bash
# Plan milestone breakdown
claude github-milestone "API v2 Migration"
# ‚Üí Analyzes breaking changes, backwards compatibility needs
# ‚Üí Type 'APPROVED' after scope confirmation
# ‚Üí Creates 12 issues with dependency mapping
# ‚Üí Issues created in GitHub with proper labels

```

## üéì Best Practices

### Planning Phase
- **Answer clarification questions thoroughly** - Better planning leads to smoother implementation
- **Review agent routing recommendations** - Specialists provide higher quality solutions
- **Modify plans when needed** - It's easier to adjust before implementation starts

### Implementation Phase
- **Review each change carefully** - Interactive checkpoints prevent mistakes
- **Let specialists handle complex work** - Trust the routing recommendations
- **Use 'REVIEW' option frequently** - Inspect progress at any point

### Documentation Phase
- **Capture learnings immediately** - Patterns are fresh in memory
- **Update related issues** - Share insights across similar work
- **Document decisions** - Future you will thank present you

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Command Not Working
```bash
# Check if Claude Code can find the configuration
ls ~/.claude/settings.json

# Verify command files exist
ls ~/.claude/commands/

# Test basic agent
claude -agent elixir-phoenix-dev "Hello"
```

### Interactive Mode Not Working
```bash
# Check interaction_mode settings in settings.json
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | grep -A 10 "interaction_mode"

# Verify approval keywords are recognized
# Use exact keywords: APPROVED, COMMIT, CONTINUE, MODIFY
```

### Agent Not Found
```bash
# Check agent definitions exist
ls ~/.claude/agents/

# Verify agent has proper yaml frontmatter with 'name' field
head -n 5 ~/.claude/agents/github-issue-planner.md
```
